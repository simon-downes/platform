# Terraform

State is stored in S3 with locking provided by DynamoDB, with the infrastructure
for both being defined under `terraform/global/state` in this repo.

When creating new Terraform definitions the backend configuration should be
passed to `terraform init`:

```
terraform init -backend-config="../../backend.tfvars"
```

The configuration can be generated by running `./generate-backend-config.sh`
